            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of 
            a document written in a markup language such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of 
            the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.[2]
        </p>
        <p>
            CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, 
            and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and 
            control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share 
            formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and 
            repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve 
            the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
